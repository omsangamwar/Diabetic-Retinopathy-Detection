## Diabetic Retinopathy Detection 

#### Diabetic Retinopathy 

Diabetic retinopathy is a severe eye condition that affects individuals with diabetes, caused by damage to the retina's blood vessels due to high blood sugar levels. This damage leads to the formation of microaneurysms, blockages, and, in advanced stages, the growth of abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) and scar tissue, which can cause vision impairment and blindness.
